## Introduction
:::

It‚Äôs good to be Taylor Swift. 

The 33-year-old singer is a megastar like no other. 

Seven months since the first show in Glendale, Arizona, her Eras Tour has done a projected \$2 billion in ticket sales and generated an additional \$6.3 billion in direct consumer spending. 

Figures that are more in line with the yearly GDP of small nations than a music tour.

What‚Äôs remarkable is that the Eras Tour has lined up every demographic and knocked them down like bowling pins. 

It‚Äôs almost unfathomable to think that you don‚Äôt know at least someone who went. 

She‚Äôs always had teenage girls and moms. But now she has the dads, boyfriends, [billionaire tech CEOs](https://people.com/girl-dad-mark-zuckerberg-brings-family-to-taylor-swift-eras-tour-7567325), and even [NFL linemen](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jj-watt-taylor-swift-eras-tour-reaction-1235289563/) singing _karma is my boyfriend_ as <b onmouseover="trigger_con()">confetti</b> falls and fireworks shoot into the night sky of whatever city-turned-Taylorpalooza she‚Äôs touring in that evening.

She is the undisputed queen on the pop-culture chessboard, moving seven spaces left, right, up, down, and diagonally, from city to city, picking up everyone in her way and leaving no crumbs. 

Just how permeating is Taylor Swift this year? 

She and The Eras Tour have done the seemingly impossible: displace football (and virtually every other topic) as the most powerful weekly constant in America‚Äôs weekly media diet. 

And speaking of football, her new love interest, [NFL superstar Travis Kelce](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-complete-timeline-1234853777/), is being called out by another [NFL superstar Aaron Rodgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IANdT1GdRE), for starring in a Pfizer commercial. Just months _after_ Aaron Rodgers [went viral](https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/fans/2023/05/30/aaron-rodgers-shows-off-his-swiftie-moves-at-taylor-swifts-eras-tour/70268160007/) for dancing to the live rendition of Style at Taylor‚Äôs concert in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 

All while [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-taylor-swift-arrives-at-broncos-chiefs-thursday-night-game-to-watch-travis-kelce/), [Fox Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/taylor-swift-expected-to-attend-chiefs-broncos-travis-kelce-questionable), and [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/38647723) simply can‚Äôt keep their cameras focused on the football field, but instead, on her.

It‚Äôs fitting that she shouldered her way into the spotlight of one of America‚Äôs most sacred traditions: Sunday football, a ritual traditionally associated with beer-drinking boyfriends and middle-aged men who want nothing to do with pop culture. 

Yet, there‚Äôs Taylor on their screens. 

The Eras Tour has simply transcended music. If you were planning to release a song or tour, do it next year. Beetmania, The Rolling Stones, Coldplay, Michael Jackson - Taylor trumps them all. 
We‚Äôre so fascinated by the cultural and economic movement that is The Eras Tour, that we wanted to break it down ourselves. Let‚Äôs see what the data says.

Taylor Swift‚Äôs first tour in 5 years kicked off in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17th, after six months of rabid internet behavior by millions of Swifties doing everything and anything trying to get a ticket. 

Demand was crushing. And Ticketmaster, the sole supplier of 2023‚Äôs golden ticket, [totally botched it](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-64384304).

Some lucky fans were given presale codes. Most were demoted to a waitlist. The only two other options were testing your luck during the general sale (following the presale) or preparing yourself to swallow the stomach-churning premiums priced into resale tickets. 

None of those logistical details ended up meaning anything. 

On November 15th, the first day of the pre-sale, Ticketmaster‚Äôs website crashed within an hour, leaving most fans with presale codes stranded in confusion and endlessly bouncing around in the purchase queue.

</center>

There may be some rhyme or reason to which fans were able to get tickets, but the simplest (and non-scientific) way to explain it is that a majority of Swifties, presale code or not, were simply ~~shit~~ entirely out of luck. 

Popular gambling website Bookies.com estimates that [only 5% of fans with presale codes](https://bookies.com/picks/taylor-swift-tickets-odds#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20calculations%2C%20you,via%20the%20Taylor%20Swift%20presale.) could purchase a ticket directly via the process.

Ticketmaster then double-downed on its incompetency, canceling the general sale of tickets, causing the price of resale tickets to [surge to thousands of dollars per ticket](https://www.businessinsider.com/resale-price-taylor-swift-eras-tour-reputation-ticket-pitchfork-report-2023-8) for some shows.

All of this triggered what can most aptly be called the Taylor Economy. 

Millions of Swifties hit up every person they could think of who had a shot at procuring them tickets. Estranged family members, coworkers they don‚Äôt particularly like, sisters of ex-boyfriends ‚Äì hopeful tour goers sent out feelers equivalent to a shameless ‚Äúu up?‚Äù 2 AM text to any potential lead. 

The algebra suddenly became _it‚Äôs cheaper to fly to Denver and spend a night at a hotel than it is to see her just 15 minutes away in Downtown LA. _

Speaking of hospitality, every major hotel chain and airline CFO needs to put Taylor Swift on their lists of people who deserve a generous bonus come the holiday season. 

According to research firm STR, The Eras Tour [generated almost $100M in hotel revenue](https://str.com/data-insights-blog/us-hotel-performance-enchanted-by-taylor-swifts-eras-tour) in its first three months. 

In Cincinnati, a single room at the Days Inn was going for [over $1,000 during her tour dates](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/entertainment/2023/06/07/where-to-stay-cincinnati-taylor-swift-concert/70298225007/), compared to just $72 one week later. [In Atlanta](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2023/03/31/swifties-surge-taylor-swift-hotel-prices.html), $900.

The power of Taylor Swift is that none of this chaos ultimately mattered. 

She [denounced Ticketmaster](https://musicmayhemmagazine.com/taylor-swift-breaks-silence-on-eras-tour-ticketmaster-fiasco-issues-statement-apologizing-to-fans/) in an Instagram story and apologized to her fans, comparing the process of getting a ticket to going through _several_ bear attacks. 

And on March 17th, kicked off the tour with _Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince_ in front of 75,000 [shrieking, crying, and euphoric Swifties](https://youtu.be/GSVrEZCmfPM?si=6tGUaglLgK2I6vYf) at State Farm Stadium. The several bear attacks endured to get there ‚Äì forgotten.

## Attendance
:::

Seven months in, there‚Äôs no other way to put it. 

The Eras Tour is a massive success. 

Over 10 million estimated attendees. $2 billion in estimated gross revenue. 17 countries. 50 cities. Almost 150 shows. 44 songs topping 3 hours. 

To put these numbers into perspective, her 2018 Reputation Tour had 3 million attendees and did only $345 million gross.

The Eras Tour will also dwarf every other tour in the history of music performance-wise. 

![](images/tswift-v-others-sankey-rect.jpg)

Within this context, the Eras Tour is staggering. 

You can flip through and across decades in the application below and reach the same conclusion we did: there is simply no one like Taylor Swift and nothing like this tour. 

Not the Rolling Stones. Not Bruce Springsteenen. Not Elton John, Ed Sheeran, or U2.

### 1980s

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: 1980s-plot
load(here::here("images", "highest-grossing-tour-1980s.rdata"))
p
```


Pink Floyd's "A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour" takes the top spot of the 1980s with $135 million, which would be about $319 million today. Michael Jackson's "Bad" tour is second, making $125 million. The Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen also did really well. It's interesting to see that some tours had fewer shows but made more money per show, like Michael Jackson and The Rolling Stones.

### 1990s

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: 1990s-plot
#| fig-align: center
load(here::here("images", "highest-grossing-tour-1990s.rdata"))
p
```

The 1990s saw even bigger numbers for concert tours than the 1980s. The Rolling Stones topped the list again but with much higher earnings. Their "Voodoo Lounge Tour" made a massive $320 million, which is more than double their highest-earning tour from the 1980s. Pink Floyd and Michael Jackson also remained strong, each earning more in the '90s than they did in the '80s. Overall, tours in the '90s made more money, and the average earnings per show also went up, showing that concerts were becoming a bigger business.

### 2000s

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: 2000s-plot
#| fig-align: center
load(here::here("images", "highest-grossing-tour-2000s.rdata"))
p
```

In the 2000s, music tours reached new heights in terms of earnings, far surpassing the numbers seen in the 1980s and 1990s. The Rolling Stones led the pack with their "A Bigger Bang Tour" from 2005‚Äì2007, pulling in an adjusted gross of about $788 million. They were followed by Madonna's "Sticky & Sweet Tour" and U2's "Vertigo Tour," both earning over $560 million when adjusted for inflation. The Police and a second tour by U2 also made it into the top 5, each earning over $425 million in today's money. These figures make the blockbuster tours of the 80s and 90s look modest in comparison. Even the highest-grossing tours of those decades, like Michael Jackson's "Bad World Tour," paled in terms of financial success. This shows that live music has become an increasingly lucrative business, with top artists raking in nearly unthinkable sums.

### 2010s

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: 2010s-plot
#| fig-align: center
load(here::here("images", "highest-grossing-tour-2010s.rdata"))
p
```

In the 2010s, music tours continued to break records, with some even surpassing the massive earnings of the 2000s. Ed Sheeran's "√∑ Tour" from 2017‚Äì2019 topped the list with an adjusted gross of about $888 million, outdoing even the Rolling Stones' 2000s blockbuster "A Bigger Bang Tour." Guns N' Roses and Coldplay also pulled in impressive numbers, each earning over $600 million in adjusted gross. These earnings show a continued upward trend from the 2000s, which were already a leap forward from the 1980s and 1990s. Artists like Michael Jackson and Madonna had set high standards in those earlier decades, but the financial success of tours has reached new heights in recent years. In comparison to the 2000s, artists like U2 and the Rolling Stones remained strong contenders in the 2010s, showing that while new artists have emerged, the classics still hold significant pulling power. Overall, the 2010s continued to prove that live music is an increasingly lucrative business, drawing in fans and dollars like never before.

### 2020s

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: 2020s-plot
#| fig-align: center
load(here::here("images", "highest-grossing-tour-2020s.rdata"))
p_2020s
```

In the 2020s, the music tour industry appears to be reaching unprecedented heights. Taylor Swift's projected gross for "The Eras Tour" in 2023 is a staggering $2.2 billion, which would shatter all previous records. Even her actual gross of $780 million for only 56 shows is already near the top of the charts, averaging nearly $14 million per show. This is a massive leap from top-grossing tours of the past decades. For context, Ed Sheeran's "√∑ Tour," which was the highest-grossing tour of the 2010s, had an adjusted gross of about $888 million. And if we go further back to the 1980s and 1990s, stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna were making history with numbers that are now dwarfed by current figures. Other artists in the 2020s, like Coldplay, Harry Styles, and Beyonc√©, are also pulling in huge numbers, each earning over $500 million in gross. Overall, the 2020s are showing that live music has become an even more massive money-maker, reaching income levels that were once unthinkable.
